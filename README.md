## What is Yapper?

Yapper is a chatbot you run in your terminal. It responds to whatever you type,it cannot store memories for now , it just uses temporary chat logs for the current chat,and it cannot store stuff in memory or use any advanced AI. Think of it as a simple starting point for future chatbot features.
