# Yapper – Simple Terminal Chatbot

Yapper is a basic terminal-based chatbot project. This is an early version, mainly built for learning and experimenting with chatbot logic in Python.

## What is Yapper?

Yapper is a chatbot you run in your terminal. It responds to whatever you type. During each chat session, Yapper keeps a **temporary log** of all messages from both you and itself to manage the conversation. However, once you close the chat, the bot forgets everything—no chat history is saved between sessions.

## Limitations

- Yapper only remembers conversation context during your current session (using a temporary log variable).
- Once the chat is closed, all memory is wiped; no conversations are saved.
- Replies are basic and may not handle complex interactions.
- No GUI yet.

## Future Plans

- Add persistent memory for conversations
- Improve response quality and context handling
- Make a GUI
- Enable the bot to do simple actions
