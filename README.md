# Yapper – Simple Terminal Chatbot

Yapper is a basic terminal-based chatbot project. This is an early version, mainly built for learning and experimenting with chatbot logic in Python.

## What is Yapper?

Yapper is a chatbot you run in your terminal. It responds to whatever you type, but doesn’t remember previous messages, store logs, or use any advanced AI. Think of it as a simple starting point for future chatbot features.
